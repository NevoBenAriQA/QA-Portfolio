Hey!

I've used ChromeDriver for Selenium and browsermob-proxy for collecting the network data.
You have to change their paths in the code for them to work.

Installation:
Install browsermob-proxy from https://bmp.lightbody.net/
Download the appropriate version of chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

I've used some packages as well - they are detailed in the requirements.txt file.
