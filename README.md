# Nevo Brn Ari QA Portfolio

## About Me
My name is Nevo Ben Ari. Embarking on a journey in the realm of Quality Assurance, I have developed a strong passion for ensuring software quality and functionality. My background has sharpened my analytical skills, allowing me to identify potential improvements and nuances in applications with precision. I have hands-on experience with tools such as Selenium, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Postman, and a solid foundation in Java. While I enjoy the intricacies of automation, I have a special affinity for manual testing â€” diving deep into the user experience and ensuring each aspect meets the highest standards. As a budding QA Engineer, I'm keen on joining a team where I can harness my skills, contribute effectively, and continue to learn and innovate.
