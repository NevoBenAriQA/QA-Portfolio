# Nevo Ben Ari QA Portfolio

## About Me
My name is Nevo Ben Ari. I'm diving into Quality Assurance, driven by a passion for software quality and functionality. My background has sharpened my analytical skills, allowing me to identify potential improvements and nuances in applications with precision.

I have hands-on experience with tools such as Selenium, Jira, Postman, and proficiency in crafting SQL queries up to the join level. While I enjoy the intricacies and benefits of automation testing, I have a special affinity for manual testing with diving deep into the user experience and ensuring each aspect meets the highest standards.

As a budding QA Engineer, I'm keen on joining a team where I can harness my skills, contribute effectively, and continue to learn and innovate.
